# Horiseon-Refactor

## My personal objective in regard to this project was to increase overall web accessibility of the existing page without altering the current functionality. 
<br>

## I did this by correcting and reformatting existing code to a higher standard of general practice. Though “technically effective,” the pre-existing html overused the div block-level-element, when much more specific and appropriate elements could be used. (This would allow for better search engine optimization and ease the burden on the average screen reader). To further enhance long-term sustainability css selectors and properties have been consolidated and organized by comments.
<br>

## The time spent on the project taught me the importance of understanding the scope of a coding project, and reinforced a deeper comprehension through repetitive coding actions.
